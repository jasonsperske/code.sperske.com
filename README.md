# picoIDE
A simple way to code on restricted devices like Chromebooks and iPads.

## Core Idea
Anyone can setup a Raspberry Pi, install as many tools and compilers as they
like and then setup picoIDE and access it from any computer in their network.
picoIDE is not designed to be a secure and open platform. It doesn't have any
user accounts, or any way to protect it's information. Anything you can code in
it's interface has permission to call and execute anything it needs on your host
computer. The goal of the project it to make it easy to setup a coding
environment on a small board computer than can be used by anyone in a house or
shared space.
